## MVP

-   ✅ Contains at least two pages (homepage and products page)
-   ✅ Homepage contains a grid of products and a carousel of featured products
-   ✅ All product information is stored in Firestore
-   ✅ Product information contains quantity, variants, price, name, image url, favourited or not

## Bonus

-   ✅ Has a cart/bag page allowing users to view their added to bag products or remove products from the bag

## Things to do

-   Check if an existing product/variant/size is in the cart and should increase the quantity by 1
-   Change the main product image based on the variant and size and associate it with the bag image
-   Hamburger navigation for better responsiveness
-   Carousel should automatically go to the next featured product after 5 seconds
-   User should be able to sort products alphabetically and based on rating, reviews and starting price
